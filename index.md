# Christophe Maingard

_I began my career as a lumberjack but quickly changed to become a Fullstack - backend oriented - developer. I've been working on all the development aspects of a project: infrastructure design, CI-CD, backend, frontend... I'm always happy to learn._

_I am looking for new opportunities as a remote Full Stack engineer, mainly in a start-up. I would like to work on a rigorous code base, preferably on a high availability service._

_I'm mostly good at javascript/typescript, but am keen on learning less dynamic languages like go/rust._ <br>
